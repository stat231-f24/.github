# Typical workflow for assignments and labs

1. Fetch updates and **pull** latest changes from **stat231-content** to your computer (e.g., via GitHub Desktop app). Check commit history to see what's new.
2. **Copy** new files from the stat231-content folder to **your private repo** on your computer. 
3. **Commit and push** new additions to your private repo in logical groups (with relevant commit messages) back to GitHub.com
4. **Edit** assignment files within **your private repo**, being sure to **commit changes** at critical points (e.g., after correct completion of a full homework problem, lab part, or once you get tough bit of wrangling code working correctly) with relevant commit messages, and **push** those changes back to GitHub.com.
5. For problem sets and certain project checkpoints, upload final PDF to Gradescope.com

# Initial setup

Make sure you have a folder dedicated to this course on your computer (e.g., "stat231", "data-science", "stat231-data-science"). The folder **must not** be in a cloud-based storage area (e.g., it cannot be an iCloud folder).

You should have read-ony or pull-only access to the "stat231-content" repo on GitHub.com in this organization.

1. **Clone the "stat231-content" repo to your computer within your course folder.** Instructions below are for GitHub Desktop users.
    1. Navigate to the **stat231-content** repo on GitHub.com.
    2. Click the green **Code** button.
    3. Select **Open with GitHub Desktop** and browse to your course folder within the prompt to save the repo there.

2. **Create a new private repository within the course organization named section-firstname-lastname** (e.g., 2-brittney-bailey).
    1. Navigate to the **course organization** on GitHub.com.
    2. Click the green **New** button to create a new repo.
    3. Name the repo in the form *section-firstname-lastname* (e.g., 2-brittney-bailey).
    4. Make sure the repo is **private**.
    5. Check **Add a README file**.
    6. Choose to **Add .gitignore** and select the **R** template.
    7. Click **Create repository**

3. **Clone your private, named repo to your computer within your course folder.** There should be two folders within your course folder by the end of this step. Instructions below are for GitHub Desktop users.
    1. Navigate to **your private repo** within our course organization on GitHub.com.
    2. Click the green **Code** button.
    3. Select **Open with GitHub Desktop** and browse to your course folder within the prompt to save the repo there.

4. **Copy the contents of the stat231-content repo over to your private repo on your local machine.** 
    1. Navigate to the **stat231-content** folder on your computer.
    2. Select all the files (`CTRL + A` or `CMD + A`) and copy them (`CTRL + C` or `CMD + C`).
    3. Navigate to your private repo folder on your computer and paste the files there (`CTRL + V` or `CMD + V`), selecting yes when prompted to replace the README file.

5. **Commit and push the new contents of your local, private repo on your computer back to GitHub.com.** Instructions below are for GitHub Desktop users.
    1. Open the GitHub Desktop app and navigate to your private repo within the app.
    2. Group files logically and **commit** them in smaller groups with relevant commit messages. For example:
        * Check the first reading set files and commit with "Add Reading Set 1"
        * Check the first lab files and commit with "Add Lab 1"
        * Check the resources folder content and commit with "Add course resources" (you will never edit these files so it's okay to commit all in one batch).
    3. **Push** all your commits to GitHub.com (you can navigate to your private repo within our organization on GitHub.com to verify).
